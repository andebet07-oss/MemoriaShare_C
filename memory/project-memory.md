| Stage 1 — Foundation | ⚠️ Partial | `useIsAdmin`, `RequireAdmin`, redirects done. `linked_event_id` migration **NOT done** |
| Stage 2 — Admin shell | ✅ Complete | AdminShell, AdminOverview, AdminEventsList, MagnetEventDashboard |
| Stage 3 — Migration | ✅ Complete | Internal navigate() targets updated, MyEvents scoped to share-only |
| Stage 4 — Cleanup | ⏳ Not started | pages.config.js, legacy route cleanup |

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

| Issue | Priority | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `linked_event_id` migration missing | **HIGH** | Add to `CLEAN_RESET_SCHEMA.sql`; add bundle toggle on `MagnetEventDashboard` |
| `public/icons/*.webp` unused | Low | Delete 4 files (camera, star, chat, calendar webp) |
| No search/filter on AdminEventsList | Medium | Add search input, filter by type/date |
| Magnet card metadata missing | Medium | Add guest count, quota used, print count to cards |
| QR preview missing on MagnetEventDashboard | Low | Reuse `qrcode.react` from EventSuccess |
| `pages.config.js` vestigial | Low | Delete or strip to Layout export only |
| `/Event` + `/EventGallery` inconsistent | Low | Redirect to `/event/:code` pattern |

## Memory & Research Infrastructure (Activated 2026-04-16)

### Memory System
- 3-layer memory: recent (48hr), long-term (rules/patterns), project (active state)
- `memory/recent-memory.md` — loaded at session start
- `memory/long-term-memory.md` — rules, patterns, gotchas, design language
- `memory/project-memory.md` — this file (active tasks, known issues, file changes)
- **Automated consolidation:** nightly at 10 PM (`consolidate-memoria-memory` task)

### Research Scout
- **Purpose:** Hunt for new information that challenges/updates documented knowledge
- **Scope:** React 18, Tailwind, Supabase, Canvas, WebRTC
- **Nightly hunt:** 10:03 PM daily (all 5 domains in one run)
- **Weekly review:** Sunday 6:03 AM (promote findings, clear staging)
- **Findings storage:** `memory/long-term-memory.md` → `new_learnings` section
- **Skill location:** `skills/research-scout/`
- **Status:** 🟢 Active (first hunt: 2026-04-16 10:03 PM)
